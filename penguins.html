                <h2>Basic facts about penguins</h2>
                <p>Penguins are aquatic, flightless birds that are highly adapted to life in the water. Their distinct tuxedo-like appearance is called countershading, a form of camouflage that helps keep them safe in the water.<br> Penguins do have wing-bones, though they are flipper-like and extremely suited to swimming. Penguins are found almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, where they catch their food underwater and raise their young on land.

                <p>
                In general, penguins closer to the equator eat more fish and penguins closer to Antarctica eat more squid and krill.
